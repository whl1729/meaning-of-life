# 《The Meaning of Life: A Reader》分析笔记

## Chapter 8: On the Meaning of Life

作者：Moritz Schlick

### Q1：这一章的内容属于哪一类别？

哲学/伦理学。

### Q2：这一章的内容是什么？

讨论人生的意义。

### Q3：这一章的大纲是什么？

- 提出问题：「人生是否有意义」
- 人生的意义无法从任何被视作手段的活动中获得
- 人生的意义可以从 play 中获得
- 人生的意义是 youth

#### 段落大意

1. 不是所有人都会被「人生是否有意义」的问题困扰。
  - 有些人还没开始思考这个问题
  - 有些人不再思考这个问题

2. 目标的实现不一定能解决「人生是否有意义」的问题。
  - 目标无法实现的人可能还会认为人生是有意义。
  - 目标已经实现的人可能会发现其回报并非那么有价值，从而认为人生无意义。

3. 提出问题：如何发现人生的意义？

4. 叔本华认为人生是一场不断追求目标的游戏，我们在痛苦与无聊的反复徘徊中走向死亡。
   我们能避免这个悲观的结局吗？

5. 尼采认为人生没有意义。（这一段不好理解）

6. 从目的出发将永远无法找到人生的终极意义。

7. 工作归根到底是追求目标的活动，而从追求目标的活动中无法找到人生的终极意义。

8. 工作只是一种手段，手段的意义只能从其目的来寻找，因此工作不可能是人生的终极意义。

9. 人生的终极意义只能从那些以自身为目的、而非一种手段的东西中获得。（不好理解）

10. 人生的意义体现在那些以自身为目的的活动中。

11. 那些以自身为目的的活动是存在的，我们称之为 play。

12. 人生的意义体现在 play 中。

13. 我们的日常活动主要还是 work，似乎没有 play 的空间。

14. play 和 work 并非对立的。一项活动可以既是 play，也是 work。

15. play 应当是创造性的，并且可以和 work 相辅相成，从而让人类社会创造出更多价值。

16. creative play 的一个例子：艺术家的创作活动。

17. creative play 的另一个例子：科学家的探索活动。

18. creative play 也难免会伴随着一些辛苦、琐碎的活动。

19. 大部分活动都有可能转化为 creative play，这个过程依靠的是创造的乐趣、全力的付出和专注的投入。

20. 当我们从目的中解脱、全力投入于当下，我们最能活出生命本身的意义来。而这是完全可以做到的。

21. 普通动物的意识只能体验短暂的当下，而人类可以体验较长时间跨度下的世界。

22. 人们可以摆脱目的的困扰，将人生转化为 creative play。

23. 人生就是一场庆祝存在的盛宴。（不理解）

24. 柏拉图认为生活应该充满戏剧和歌舞，但现实中人们的生活更多是被工作占满。

25. 人们努力追求一天、一小时、甚至哪怕一分钟的真正纯粹的生活。（我概括得不好）

26. 人生不能只有 work，还需要有 play。不能只有 toil，还需要有 joy。

27. 注意 please 和 joy 的区别。creative play 带给我们的是 joy。

28. 年轻时期（youth），意味着没被目的的黑云所遮蔽。

29. 下面是我想说的重点内容。

30. 人生的意义体现在 youth 中。年轻人热情投入地做事情，这种行为便是 play。

31. 人生的意义体现在年轻时期，这与传统观念不相符：人们一般认为年轻时期仅仅是实现后期人生目的一个手段。

32. 年轻时期有其自身的价值，不应将其视为追求未来的一种手段。

33. 现代人一般只会在现今世界中寻找人生的意义。（而不是来世或者别的什么）

34. 不断地追寻和关注未来，将导致无法享受当下的快乐，也把自己的人生变成了追求某种目的的手段。

35. youth 的本质是热情快乐地活动，而不局限于青少年时期，中年或老年同样可以拥有这个状态。

36. Again，年轻代表着热情。

37. 现在，读者应该明白「人生的意义是年轻」的含义了。

38. 人生中处于年轻的时间越多，就越有价值。即使某个人英年早逝，他的人生也拥有意义。（因为他年轻过。）

### Q4：作者想要解决什么问题？

### Q5：这一章的关键词是什么？

- Schopenhauer's pessimistic view of life
- the Nietzsche of Zarathustra
- play
- youth

### Q6：这一章的关键句是什么？

- But the man who has wrested from fate the achievement of his purposes,
  and then finds that his prize was not so valuable as it seemed,
  that he has somehow fallen prey to a deception—
  that man is quite blankly confronted with the question of life’s value,
  and before him lies like a darkened wasteland the thought, not only that all things pass, but also that everything is ultimately in vain.

> 伍注：这让我想起了 TED 演讲《温和的成功哲学》最后说的几句话：
> 「我们不该放弃我们对成功的想象，
>   但必须确定那些都是我们自己想要的，
>   我们应该专注于自己的目标，确定这目标是我们真正想要的，确定这个梦想蓝图出自自己笔下，
>   因为得不到自己想要的已经够糟糕了，更糟糕的是，在人生旅程的终点，发觉你所追求的，从来就不是你真正想要的。」

- Once the goal is reached, however, after the first flush of triumph has passed away, there follows inevitably a mood of desolation.
  A void remains, which can seemingly find an end only through the painful emergence of new longings, the setting of new goals.
  So the game begins anew, and existence seems doomed to be a restless swinging to and fro between pain and boredom, which ends at last in the nothingness of death.
  That is the celebrated line of thought which Schopenhauer made the basis of his pessimistic view of life. 

> 伍注：叔本华认为，人生就是不断地追求目标，我们在痛苦与无聊的反复徘徊中走向死亡。
> 我几周前也有过类似的感受：当时我赢得了跟前室友的单词打赌，收获了胜利的喜悦，但很快也收获了精神的空虚。

- In truth, we shall never find an ultimate meaning in existence, if we view it only under the aspect of purpose.

> 伍注：从目的出发将永远无法找到生存的终极意义？为什么？

- The present idolizes work. But work means goal-seeking activity, direction to a purpose.

- If, on learning the immediate goal, you were to ask further about the purpose of this goal, and again for the purpose of that purpose,
  you would almost always hit on the purpose after just a few steps in the sequence: maintenance of life, earning one’s bread.
  And why maintain life?
  To this question you could seldom read off an intelligible answer from the information obtained.

> 伍注：从目的出发，我们总能递归地追问更深一层的目的，从而陷入困境。

- It is therefore the characteristic mark of work that it has its purpose outside itself, and is not performed for its own sake.
  The doctrine that would wish to install work as such at the centre of existence, and exalt it to life’s highest meaning, is bound to be in error,
  because every work-activity as such is always a mere means, and receives its value only from its goals.

> 伍注：所有作为手段的活动都只能从其目的中寻找意义，因此注定不可能是终极意义。

- The core and ultimate value of life can lie only in such states as exist for their own sake and carry their satisfaction in themselves.

> 伍注：生存本身是目的，而非手段，这种状态下才可能找到人生的意义？这句话不明觉厉。

- Life means movement and action, and if we wish to find a meaning in it we must seek for activities which carry their own purpose and value within them,
  independently of any extraneous goals.

- If such activities exist, then in them the seemingly divided is reconciled, means and end, action and consequence are fused into one,
  we have then found ends-in-themselves which are more than mere end-points of acting and resting-points of existence,
  and it is these alone that can take over the role of a true content to life.

> 伍注：人生的意义体现在那些以自身为目的的活动中。这个观点值得思考。

- We must call them play, since that is the name for free, purposeless action, that is, action which in fact carries its purpose within itself.

> 伍注：怎么翻译 play？游戏、玩耍？

- The poet sees a state of divine perfection among men, in which all their activities are turned into joyous play, all their working-days become holidays.

- Only insofar as man shares in this perfection, only in the hours when life smiles at him without the stern frown of purpose, is he really man.

- And it was sober consideration that led us to this very truth: the meaning of existence is revealed only in play.

> 伍注：人生的意义体现在 play 中。

- There is no irreconcilable opposition between play in the philosophical sense and work in the economic meaning of the term.
  - Play, as we see it, is any activity which takes place entirely for its own sake, independently of its effects and consequences.
  - There is nothing to stop these effects from being of a useful or valuable kind.
  - If they are, so much the better; the action still remains play, since it already bears its own value within itself.

> 伍注：play 和 work 可以是辩证统一的。

- If mankind is to go on existing and progressing by way of playful activities, they will have to be creative;
  the necessary muse somehow be brought forth by means of them.

- The more activities, indeed, become play in the philosophical sense,
  the more work would be accomplished in the economic sense,
  and the more values would be created in human society.

- Not all the activity of the artist or thinker falls, of course, under the concept of creative play.

- Nor is it even so uncommon for a man to take so much pleasure in such activities, that he forgets the purpose of them.

- It is the joy in sheer creation, the dedication to the activity, the absorption in the movement, which transforms work into play.

> 伍注：创造的快乐、全力的付出、专注的投入，能够把 work 转化为 play。

- But no specific goal stands there as an end to be necessarily attained, so that the whole road would be meaningless if it were not;

- Every point of the whole road already has its own intrinsic meaning,
  like a mountain path that offers sublime views at every step and new enchantments at every turn,
  whether it may lead to a summit or not. 

> 伍注：人生道路并没有一个终极的目标，人生道路的每个节点自有其内在的意义。

- The setting of certain goals is admittedly needed in order to produce the tension required for life;
  even playful activity is constantly setting itself tasks, most palpably in sport and competition,
  which still remains play so long as it does not degenerate into real fighting.

- But such goals are harmless, they impose no burden on life and do not dominate it;
  they are left aside and it does not matter if they are not achieved, since at any moment they can be replaced by others.

> 伍注：设定目标对 creative play 是无害的，可以提供一些必需的紧张感。

- Stretches of life that stand under the dominion of huge inexorable purposes are like riddles with an answer that we either find or fail at;
  but a life of play might be compared to an endless crossword puzzle,
  in which new words are constantly being found and connected, so that an ever larger area is progressively filled in,
  with no other aim but that of going on further without a halt.

> 伍注：游戏人生，正如玩一个无边无际的纵横字谜游戏，不断会有新发现，但又永远不会终止。

- The end, then, would never justify the means, he might then exalt into his highest rule of action the principle:
  "What is not worth doing for its own sake, don’t do for anything else’s sake!"

> 伍注：行动的最高原则？不理解。

- All life would then be truly meaningful, down to its ultimate ramifications;
  to live would mean: to celebrate the festival of existence.

> 伍注：不理解。

- If it is not possible to realize Schiller's dream, there is all the more need to follow Goethe's rule of life:
  "Work by day, at evening guests, toilsome weeks and joyous feasts."

- In our own civilization, joyous feasts are not possible without toilsome weeks, but in no age is a lasting life possible without joy and festivities.
  - A life that is constantly focussed only on distant goals eventually loses all power of creation whatsoever.
  - It is like a bow that is always bent: in the end it can no longer loose off the arrow, and with that its tension becomes pointless.

> 伍注：往浅里说就是「劳逸结合」。人生不能只有 work，还需要 play，需要 joy。

- Pleasure vs Joy
  - Pleasure wearies, while joy refreshes; the latter enriches, the former puts a false sheen upon existence.
  - Both indeed, lead us away from daily toil and distract us from care, but they do it in different ways:
    pleasure by diverting us, joy by pulling us together.
  - Diversion offers the spirit fleeting excitement, without depth or content;
    for joy there is more needed, a thought or feeling which fills the whole man, an inspiration which sets him soaring above everyday life.

- He can only joy whole-heartedly about things which completely take hold of him, he has to be utterly devoted to something.

> 伍注：作者对比了 pleasure 和 joy 的区别。我以前也意识到快乐也是分层次、分等级的——有些快乐比其他快乐更深刻、更透彻。
> 比如，解决一个难题的快乐，要比看一个搞笑视频的快乐，更深刻。

- It is precisely the child that is capable of the purest joy.

- youth is really not overshadowed by the dark clouds of purpose.

> 伍注：所谓年轻，就是没被目的的黑云所遮蔽的状态。

- The meaning of the whole is concentrated and collected, rather, into a few short hours of deep, serene joy, into the hours of play.
  And these hours crowd thickest in **youth**.

> 伍注：人生的意义集中体现在年轻时期。这真是个新颖的观点啊！

- Youth does not really care about purposes;
  if one collapses, another is quickly built up;
  goals are merely an invitation to rush in and fight, and this enterprising ardour is the true fulfilment of the youthful spirit.

- The enthusiasm of youth, is devotion to the deed, not the goal.
  This act, this way of acting, is true play.

> 伍注：热情、大胆开拓、全力投入，这些便是年轻的精神。这种行为便是真正的 play。

- what a paradox it is that the time of preparation appears as the sweetest portion of existence,
  while the time of fulfilment seems the most toilsome. 

- He warns the educator against debasing the youth of the pupil into a mere means and sacrificing his early happiness to later proficiency;
  the aim should be to fill the days of youth with joy, even for their own sake. 

- Youth is not just a time of growing, learning, ripening and incompleteness,
  but primarily a time of play, of doing for its own sake, and hence a true bearer of the meaning of life.

- Anyone denying this, and regarding youth as a mere introduction and prelude to real life,
  commits the same error that beclouded the mediaeval view of human existence:
  he shifts life’s centre of gravity forwards, into the future. 

> 伍注：年轻时期有其自身的价值，不应将其视为追求未来的一种手段。

- The final result is that man lets his whole life fall under the curse of purposes.

- It is the unceasing search into the future and concern for the future that casts its shadow over every present and clouds the joy of it.

> 伍注：不断地追寻和关注未来，会导致无法享受当下的快乐，也把自己的人生变成追求某种目的的手段。

- But if life has a meaning, it must lie in the present, for only the present is real.
  There is no reason at all, however, why more meaning should lie in the later present, in the middle or final period of life,
  than in an earlier present, in the first period, known as youth.

> 伍注：人生的意义必定体现在当下。

- What "youth" actually mean
  - We found its true nature, not in the fact that it is a prelude and first phase of life,
    but rather in that it is the time of play, the time of activity for the pleasure of acting.
  - And we recognized that all action, even the creative action of the adult, can and must, in its perfect form, take on the same character:
    it becomes play, self-sufficient action that acquires its value independently of the purpose.

> 伍注：youth 的本质是热情快乐地活动。因此 youth 并不局限于青少年，中年或老年同样可以拥有这个状态。

- Youth is present wherever the state of man has reached a peak,
  where his action has become play,
  where he is wholly given over to the moment and the matter in hand.

- We talk in such cases of youthful enthusiasm, and that is the right expression: **enthusiasm is always youthful**. 

> 伍注：年轻代表着热情。作者反复强调这一点。

- All true greatness is full of a deep innocence.
  The creativity of genius is the play of a child, his joy in the world is the child’s pleasure in pretty things.

> 伍注：真正的伟大充满着天真无邪。天才的创造正如小孩的玩耍，天才从世界获得的快乐正如小孩从美好东西获得的快乐。

- The meaning of life is youth.

- The more youth is realized in a life, the more valuable it is,
  and if a person dies young, however long he may have lived, his life has had meaning.
